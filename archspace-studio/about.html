      <h1>About ArchSpace Studio</h1>
      <p class="lead">ArchSpace Studio was founded in 2014 with a simple purpose: to make architecture that responds to place and people with equal care.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="founding">
      <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>What began as a two-person practice focused on experimental residential projects grew into a multi-disciplinary studio. Across urban and rural commissions, the practice has kept a consistent method — a deep reading of site, pragmatic detailing, and a rigorous focus on occupant comfort.</p>
      <p>Our portfolio spans sensitive conservation projects, low-energy homes and civic buildings. We believe that constraints spur creativity; we often take on complex sites and ambiguous briefs precisely because we see them as generative.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="team">
      <h2>People</h2>
      <p>Our team brings together architects, landscape designers, model-makers, and sustainability consultants. We value diverse perspectives and maintain a studio culture that balances craft-based learning and research-led practice.</p>

    <section class="philosophy">
      <h2>Design philosophy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Context first:</strong> We start with the site and the people.</li>
        <li><strong>Rigour in craft:</strong> Detailing is non-negotiable.</li>
        <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Material and systems thinking ensure enduring value.</li>
