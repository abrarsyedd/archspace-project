      <h2>What we believe</h2>
      <p>Architecture is a social and environmental act. Our work is guided by three fundamentals: context, craft, and climate. We begin each project by listening — to site conditions, to the people who will inhabit the building, and to the subtle stories contained in the land. This humility leads to architecture that is both elegant and rigorous.</p>
      <p>Our process weaves research, thoughtful material selection, energy-conscious strategies, and precise detailing. Whether we're refurbishing a heritage home, designing a community center, or delivering a small urban infill, our goal is always to create spaces that age gracefully and support meaningful experience.</p>

        <h3>Collaborative design</h3>
        <p>We work as collaborators. The best outcomes arise when clients, engineers, consultants and communities are part of the conversation from the earliest moments. This collaborative approach reduces risk, enriches design and creates buildings with long-term cultural value.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Material honesty</h3>
        <p>We select materials for durability, low environmental impact, and tactile quality. The palette favors natural finishes—timber, stone, clay and carefully specified metals—paired with modern engineering where appropriate.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Climate-responsible strategies</h3>
        <p>Every project integrates passive design tactics, efficient systems, and lifecycle thinking to reduce energy use and carbon impact. We design for comfort first, then add technology thoughtfully and minimally.</p>

          <h3>The River House</h3>
          <p>Perched on an angled riverside site, The River House explores indoor-outdoor relationships through layered terraces, operable screens, and long-span timber beams. The house repurposes a ruined boathouse frame, preserving memory while inserting contemporary performance.</p>
          <h4>Key moves</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Adaptive reuse of an existing frame, reducing embodied carbon.</li>
            <li>Thermally-broken glazing and passive-stack ventilation for summer comfort.</li>
            <li>Locally-sourced timber and stone to anchor the building within its place.</li>

        <h3>1. The Slow Art of Detail</h3>
        <p>Details are the final sentence in an architectural story. They determine how a threshold feels, how light filters into a room, and how a handrail will weather over decades. Over-investing in detail is not indulgence — it's the path to buildings that sing.</p>

        <h3>2. Climate as Constraint and Opportunity</h3>
        <p>Designing for climate is not merely an engineering problem; it is an aesthetic opportunity. Orientation, materiality and thermal mass become compositional elements that shape daylight, shadow and the lived experience of a space.</p>
